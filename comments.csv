‚Äú‚ÄòI said, ‚ÄòJim how‚Äôs your impression on China?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòWell, I think the most important problem facing the world today is poverty. And here in my visit I found 1.3 billion people pulling themselves out of poverty by their own bootstraps and that is a contribution not only to themselves but also to the world‚Äô.‚Äù

Though Simons is better known for his (probably) hundred billion dollar+ company that outperformed all other investors, including Buffet, while independently inventing Machine Learning to do so, his work inventing Differential Cohomology (as he called it in a great video where he gives a lecture) is fascinating and provided powerful tools for physicists like Witten to use.

Aside since I love lists‚Ä¶

My favorite contemporary mathematicians:

1. Grothendieck
2. Penrose
3. Atiyah
4. Yau and Simons"
Ameya Athalye,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMSZ8EBP9fkdVeC8TV9p3tFGZoKgqBa9ng,Vice President - Nomura,"Very well summarized. Not only did he create the greatest hedge fund in Renaissance but also established one of the world's best philanthropic centers in Simons foundation.

Over the years through his interviews you sense how much he cared about the advancements of natural sciences, mathematics and fundamental research - Flatiron Institute, Quanta Magazine, World Science Festival just to name few.

Sadly the world has lost an absolute legend of a man..RIP!"

He was a great theoretician and a great practitioner. He managed to master the beauty of Characteristic Classes in maths and to make the randomness of financial markets into a consistent unparallel money machine of Sharpe ratios > 2 or 3. Without mentioning his support to science through his Simons foundation.
