# Take-Home Assignment: LinkedIn Post Comment Scraper

#Objective:
#Develop a web scraper that extracts all comments from a specific LinkedIn post along with the profiles of the commenters.

#Background:
#For this assignment, you will build a scraper that collects data from interactions on LinkedIn posts, such as comments and commenter profiles.

#Requirements:
#- Your program should accept a LinkedIn post URL as user input.
#- Extract all comments on the post.
#- For each comment, retrieve and include the following information:
#- Name
#- LinkedIn URL
#- Current Position
#- Comment Text

#Instructions:
#1. Setup Environment:
#- Use Python for this project.
#- Use libraries like `selenium` for browser automation. Ensure the web driver is configured properly.

#2. Input Handling:
#- The program should validate the input URL to ensure it's a valid LinkedIn post link and handle any input errors.

#3. Data Extraction:
#- Navigate to the specified post URL.
#- If necessary, implement logic to scroll through the comment section to fully load all comments.
#- Extract the required details (name, LinkedIn URL, position, comment) for each commenter.

#4. Data Output:
#- Display the extracted data in a readable format.
#- Optionally, save the data to a CSV file using the `csv` module in Python.

#5. Documentation:
#- Provide detailed comments in your code to explain your logic.
#- Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the program.

#6. Submission:
#- Upload your complete project to a public GitHub repository.
#- Include all necessary files and detailed setup instructions in the repository.
#- Ensure your code runs without errors and is well-documented.

#Evaluation Criteria:
#- Accuracy of the scraped data.
#- Code quality, organization, and readability.
#- Robustness in handling edge cases and errors.
#- Efficiency and speed of the scraping process.
